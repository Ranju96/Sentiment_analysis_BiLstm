### Methodology
Part-1
Sentiment analysis using Classification 

    1.Random Forest Classifier
    2.Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
    3.Support Vector Classifier
    
2.Sentiment analysis using Bidirectional LSTM 
After training machine learning models, a deep learning model, Bidirectional LSTM model is trained on the given dataset.

3.Sentiment analysis using Transformer based model with BERT-based word embedding
After training machine learning models, a deep learning model, Transformer based model with BERT-based word embedding. is trained on the given dataset.

#### Results
1.classification model  performed best  auc score of 0.74 random forest as compared to other machine learning models
2.BILSTM model-(sequential) performed best  auc score of 0.98 as compared to other machine learning models.
3.Transformer based model with BERT-based word embedding. performed best  auc score of 0.51as compared to other machine learning models.
